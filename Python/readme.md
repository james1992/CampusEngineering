Python
-------

I have the most experience working with Python which is why the majority of the files in this repository are Python scripts.  I work extensively with the arcpy library to complete GIS tasks in Python.  The majority of these tasks are related to database management in one way or another.  

The folders you will find and the scripts they contain are as follows:

1. Attachments
  1. Export GIS Attachments
  2. Import GIS Attachments
2. Database Management
  1. Copy Backup Files
  2. Create Replica Annual
  3. Rebuild Indexes
3. Domains
  1. GIS Domains to Excel
  2. Reordered Table To Domain
4. Equipment Inventory
  1. Equipment Inventory Additions
5. Landscape Analysis
