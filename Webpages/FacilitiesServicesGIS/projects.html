Users can now print PDF floor plans that show specific GeoSIMS space information such as space by category, by department, or by primary use. The pre-defined layouts provide a color coded print that is automatically rotated to fit the page perfectly and give you the best display possible.</p>

                            <p>Evacuation Map Editor was developed for Environmental Health &amp; Safety (EH&amp;S) to track and manage evacuation maps, evacuation routes, emergency assembly points, and other related assets.</p>

                            <blockquote>We used to hire outside graphic designers to develop the artwork and we had no ability to make edits. We are now doing this in house at a much lower cost when there is a need using UW students. This initiative aligns with TAP principles. The current project to develop evacuation route maps for campus buildings has exceeded my expectations. EH&amp;S is data rich and we are looking for opportunities to make better use of this information. I believe there may be many opportunities to consider. It has been a very good investment.<footer>Mark Murray, Assistant Director, EH&amp;S</footer></blockquote>

                        <p>Our new robust GIS infrastructure can link information from database systems throughout the campus and create maps showing the space data.</p>
                        <p>For example, MAPS could create an interactive map showing the locations and contact info for members of your department. Other projects include mapping of locations and data for fire extinguishers, emergency evacuation routes, construction project boundaries, floor coverings, recycling and compost bins, or even the closest places to get coffee on the campus. MAPS GIS can be used to better understand the utilization of campus spaces and the resources required to maintain them. The possibilities are endless! You provide and maintain the data.  We provide the maps and applications to manage it.</p>
