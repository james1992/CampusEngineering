This gives you the ability to access and update your data from any web-enabled device, whether you are sitting in your office, out in the field, or sipping a café at the UW campus in Rome.  Your data and the map are linked. Updating one will instantly update the other.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Sharing is Caring:</strong> Our maps allow you to share links to buildings, floors, rooms, asset data, images, and supporting docs.

This free, no-login, and mobile-friendly website is designed to make getting around on campus easier, with less time wasted wandering the halls. Navigator provides step by step directions to over 14,000 possible destinations, both in and outdoors. The site has routes for nearly every academic, housing, and administrative building on the Seattle campus. </p>
							<h4>YOUR FEEDBACK IS VITAL</h4>
							<p>Our soft-launch, which kicked off on May 21<sup>st</sup>, is focused on improving the user experience around the feedback we receive from staff and Students. How you move through the website, which features are less than obvious, and what strange terms are commonly searched for will all be looked at. To send us feedback, click the envelope icon on the sidebar, or contact the <a target="_top" href="mailto:careteam@uw.edu?Subject=Navigator%20Feedback">Customer Care Team</a> with the subject “Navigator Feedback.”</p>

                                <p>Our interactive maps not only let you travel the exteriors of campus, but they also let you dive inside buildings, floors, and rooms. They can even take you to distant lands like Friday Harbor or Big Beef Creek.</p>
                                <p>But wait...there’s more!</p>
                                <p>Come learn how our maps can help you keep your assets in check.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words:</strong> Our maps can provide a graphical representation of your asset data by linking it with an interactive map we continuously maintain.</li>
                                    <li><strong>One Big Mappy Family:</strong> Our maps can link your asset data with asset data from other departments.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Updating Data on the Web in Real Time:</strong> Our maps reside on the web. This gives you the ability to access and update your data from any web-enabled device, whether you are sitting in your office, out in the field, or sipping a café at the UW campus in Rome.  Your data and the map are linked. Updating one will instantly update the other.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Sharing is Caring:</strong> Our maps allow you to share links to buildings, floors, rooms, asset data, images, and supporting docs. They can also be used to connect to other campus resources such as GeoSIMS and FIL (Facilities Information Library). </li>
                                    <li><strong>Need a Floorplan?</strong> Our maps provide a quick easy way to view and print floorplans.</li>

                            <p>On March 14th, more than 50 UW departments and teams gathered in the HUB Lyceum to showcase the innovative ways they are improving UW processes. The room was filled with posters displaying improvements in operations, administration, research, and curriculum/teaching.</p>

                            <p>CSM MAPS and Real Estate showcased their collaborative effort to produce more accurate and reliable floorplans, OTCS's, and space utilization records by connecting lease information with existing space data in the GIS infrastructure.</p>

                            <p>Evacuation Map Editor was developed for Environmental Health &amp; Safety (EH&amp;S) to track and manage evacuation maps, evacuation routes, emergency assembly points, and other related assets.</p>
                            <p>This initiative replaced inefficient and expensive practices that could no longer be funded.</p>

                            <blockquote>We used to hire outside graphic designers to develop the artwork and we had no ability to make edits. We are now doing this in house at a much lower cost when there is a need using UW students. This initiative aligns with TAP principles. The current project to develop evacuation route maps for campus buildings has exceeded my expectations. EH&amp;S is data rich and we are looking for opportunities to make better use of this information. I believe there may be many opportunities to consider. It has been a very good investment.<footer>Mark Murray, Assistant Director, EH&amp;S</footer></blockquote>

                        <p>If you have the data... we can map it!</p>
                        <p>Our new robust GIS infrastructure can link information from database systems throughout the campus and create maps showing the space data.</p>
                        <p>For example, MAPS could create an interactive map showing the locations and contact info for members of your department. Other projects include mapping of locations and data for fire extinguishers, emergency evacuation routes, construction project boundaries, floor coverings, recycling and compost bins, or even the closest places to get coffee on the campus. MAPS GIS can be used to better understand the utilization of campus spaces and the resources required to maintain them. The possibilities are endless! You provide and maintain the data.  We provide the maps and applications to manage it.</p>
