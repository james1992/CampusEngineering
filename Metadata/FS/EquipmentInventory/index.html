        <td>The purpose of this feature class is to capture the location of all high value equipment (as determined by the UW Equipment Inventory Office) that is managed by UW Facilities.  
		For equipment over 5000 dollars in value the state requires regular audits to verify that it is not lost or stolen.  A spatial representation of the last know location of the asset 
		helps equipment custodians locate the asset during an audit.  
		The custodians are also able to perform their inspection through a smart phone or tablet in real time through a related table.</td>
