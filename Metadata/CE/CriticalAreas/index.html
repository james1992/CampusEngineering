        <td>Part of the critical areas project led by Engineering Services, this map identifies which buildings contain critical systems (animal labs, server rooms, etc.) and what departments manage those systems.  In addition, this map identifies rooms within buildings that contain these critical systems.  The long term goal is to identify the utilities that serve these systems to identify the utilities that serve these systems to improve the maintenance and management of campus</td>
