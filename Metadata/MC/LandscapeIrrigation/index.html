        <td>This feature class contains a complete inventory of the green landscape of the Seattle Campus of the University of Washington. 
		The feature class identifies the type of landscape (lawn, bed, etc.), if it is irrigated, the maintenance level and maintenance zone.</br>
		The information is used by the gardeners to understand the dimensions and areas of the landscaping they maintain so they can correctly order supplies and allocate time.  
		It is also used by UW FS leadership to understand human resource allocation requirements to effectively meet the needs of campus landscape.</td>
