        <td>Description</td>
        <td>The University of Washington is required to not only install but also regularly inspect indoor and outdoor backflow preventers to ensure they are functioning properly.  
		Inspections are recorded in a seperate application known as XC2 but the spatial location of these assets is recorded in GIS.  
		It was difficult for the UW Facilities personnel to locate the backflow preventers they needed to inspect so they are located in GIS with their XC2 ID and in many cases pictures 
		are associated with the points to add in locating the assets.</td>
