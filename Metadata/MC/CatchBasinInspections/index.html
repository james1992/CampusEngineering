        <td>Description</td>
        <td>The University of Washington is required to inspect and service its catch basins on an annual basis to ensure that they are free of debris and other 
		objects that would inhibit their designed function of preventing sediment and debris from entering local waterways.  
		The catch basin locations are pulled from the stormwater utility drawing that is maintained by the Engineering Services Civil Engineer from use in GIS.  
		The catch basin locations are associated with a related inspection table that the shop personnel that inspect and services these assets fill out during their site visit.  
		These points are used to display and track the progress of cleaning and inspecting these catch basins so that progress can be conveyed to University leadership and the City of Seattle.  
		With this information informed maintenance decision can be made regarding staffing and preventative maintenance priorities.</td>
