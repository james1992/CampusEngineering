        <td>This feature class contains the location of building life safety systems that are maintained by Campus Engineering & Operations on the Seattle Campus of the University of Washington.  
		These systems include fire alarm panels, sprinklers, elevators, air handling units and emergency generators.  
		These systems are recorded within the building they serve but there is no attempt to locate the point into the specific physical location within the building, 
		the points are merely a representation of what is in a building. Their primary purpose is as place to record inspections and attach records for each system.  
		There are two associate tables for this purpose, one for annual inspections and another for maintenance reports.</td>
