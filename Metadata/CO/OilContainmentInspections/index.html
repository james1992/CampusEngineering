        <td>The purpose of this dataset is to track the location of oil containment devices (transformers, hydraulic elevators, bulk oil storage containers, etc.) 
		that require regular inspection to ensure that they are not leaking their contents.  
		The environmental engineer within UW Engineering Services is responsible for certifying that these assets are regularly inspected in accordance with applicable regulations.  
		This feature class tracks the location of these assets, the amount of oil they contain, what type of equipment contains the oil and who performs the inspection.  
		This is associated with the Inspections table that records when each asset was inspected.</td>
