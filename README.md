Scripts
-------

### Python

The python scripts I write typically focus on database management as I work primarily as a datababase administrator instead of geoscientist.  I will add new scripts to this repository once I get them to what I consider to be at least an acceptable draft level.

Here are some examples of the scripts I have posted here:

1. Weekly sync of database replicas
2. Create an anual archive
3. Weekly table to domain and domain to table sync

### SQL

I will be putting up some scripts for various views and stored procedures that I am currently working on.

#### JavaScript

I intend to eventually create at least some basic JavaScript based web maps running off the ArcGIS JavaScript API.  This is a future goal and will not be populated in the near future.

Data
----

### Geojson

I will host some publicly available data in geojson format soon, data can also be accessed through WAGDA from the archive databases that are maintained by the UW Libraries.
