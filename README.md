Scripts
-------

### Python

The python scripts I write typically focus on database management as I work primarily as a datababase administrator instead of geoscientist.  I will add new scripts to this repository once I get them to what I consider to be at least an acceptable draft level.

Here are some examples of the scripts I have posted here:
1. Weekly sync of database replicas
2. Create an anual archive
3. Weekly table to domain and domain to table sync
4. 

### SQL


#### JavaScript
